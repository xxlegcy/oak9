<p style="font-size: 25px">There are many different game systems in this world but today im going to be talking about the top 3 best video game systems in the world.</p>
<p style="font-size: 25px ">Starting at number one  we have the PlayStation 5 and the Xbox Series X, the reason why the PlayStation 5 and the Xbox are at number 1 is because nobody really knows whats number 1 everybody has there on opinion about it but I would put them both at number one because there both great systems. At number 2 we have the  Nintendo Switch Gaming Console there reason why this is at number 2 is because this gives more of a DS gaming systems rather than a PS4 or an Xbox but it's still a great gaming system and it has many different games like Mario kart or Super Smash Bros. Last but not lest at number 3 we have the Wii, now the reason why this is last is becuase the Nintendo Switch kinda took over the wii when it comes to better games and better graphic, but overall the Wii was a great experience.</p>
